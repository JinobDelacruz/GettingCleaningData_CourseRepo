DATA DICTIONARY – Tidy Dataset for Course Project


The Tidy Dataset is a data.table with 68 columns and 180 rows of aggregated data.
The variables corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the measurements from the experiment are in columns.
The rows contains the average value of the variables for each activity and each subject.

Next you will find a brief description of the columns.
